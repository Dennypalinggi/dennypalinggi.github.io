About me
======
Currently I am a Data Scientist at [ZebraX](https://www.zebrax.id/), where I work on various projects such as digital control tower and IoT data analytics. I also have a master’s degree in Geospatial technologies from Jaume I University & University of Münster, advised by [Francisco Ramos, PhD](http://pixel.uji.es/francisco/) (Castellón de la Plana, Spain 2019), and a bachelor in Computer Science from Satya Wacana Christian University (Salatiga, Indonesia 2014).
